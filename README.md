Share Me lets you anonymously create lists that you can easily share with a link. This is especially useful if you want to share a shopping list, to-do list with your colleagues, and such, without the hassle of creating an account.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Just follow the steps below and you should be good to go.

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nheek/shareme.git your-project
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

### Development <a name="development"></a>

Run the development server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

You can now access your development site in localhost:8000.

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Create anonymous lists without the hassle of any account creation. Just enter the website, and the platform will generate a new list for you and you're good to go! You can use it to make lists and edit the items just by clicking on them, the same goes for the title.

Once ready to share, there's a "Copy Link" button that automatically copies the link for you on click. Otherwise, you can make a new list and start all over again! Without losing your old list, of course.

### Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>

Deploy using your preferred deployment method.

### Built With <a name="built-with"></a>
